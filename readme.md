## Description
The goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization with live streams of data.  Specifically, one aspect of the project is to make sense of the massive amounts of chats that occur during a Twitch Live Stream.  Another aspect is to create a user friendly experience to interact with a twitter feed by posting/viewing feeds as well as deriving greater insights through visualizations about specific topics such as:
* common word associations
* sentiment of topic
* popular location of topic

## Intended Users
The target audience of this project is on the one hand anyone who views popular Twitch streams and on the other hand anyone who wants to perceive an added layer of meaning within the Twittersphere.

## User Experience
Users simply have to enter the url of a livestream on twitch or any topic for twitter to immediately receive visualizations.
